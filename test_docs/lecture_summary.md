## Lecture Summary
Trees and graphs enable flexible representation of data relationships.
Hash tables provide fast access using a hashing function to compute storage indices.
Binary trees can degrade to linked lists without balancing techniques.
Choosing the correct structure depends on storage needs and search operations.
