Binary search trees support insertion, searching, and deletion in logarithmic time when balanced.
Graphs can represent relationships like road networks, social connections, or program dependencies.
Hash maps store key-value pairs and allow constant time average search complexity.
Efficient searching depends heavily on using the correct underlying data structure.
